# Part 1

At this first part, we stablish a basic set of rules in order to create a simple
melody.

The rules are as follows: 

1. The melody must be in a major scale.
2. The note range of the melody should ideally be between 17 and 24 semitones,
    given the lowest note of the voice.
3. Subsequent step can be:
    - Adjacent diatonic notes
    - A leap of a 3rd, 4th, 5th or octave.
4. The greater the leap, the higher the channce to take an adjacent step in the
    opposite direction.
5. The melody must end on the tonic chord (I, III, V).

If those set of rules are well managed, the melody will ressemble 'medieval'
music.
