# Part 2

At the second part, we introduce a new set of rules in order to create a second
melody parallel to the first one, creating a counterpoint.

The rules are as follows (for two voices):

1. Each of the melodies should still follow the rules established in the first
   part.
2. The melodies should be in the same key.
3. The interval between the two melodies should be unison, 3rd, 5th, 6th or octave.
4. The melodies should preferrably not cross each other.
5. Prefer contrary over oblique over parallel motion.
6. Avoid (except for final cadence):
    - Parallel 5ths
    - Parallel octaves
    - Tritones
7. Allow:
    - Parallel 3rds (at most 2 consecutive times)
    - Parallel 6ths (at most 2 consecutive times)

If those set of rules are well managed, the melody will ressemble tonal and
modal music (the beginning of western harmony).

Notes:
- In general, 'cantus firmus' starts and ends at the root note.
